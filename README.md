## Purpose

The access service exists to help answer the following questions for each persona:

- All Users
  - What do I have access to?
  - What does a teammate have access to that I donâ€™t?
  - What groups and roles are available?
  - Can I get access?
- Team Leads
  - How do I give access to a new team member easily?
  - How do I give temporary access to an individual for a cross-functional effort?
  - Which roles do I administer?
  - How can I create, merge, or split a role based on a team re-org?
- Application Owners
  - Who has access to my application?
  - How do I setup access for a new application?
  - How do I create a new access group for my application?
  - How do I give a role access to one of my application's groups?

## Development Setup

Access is a React and Typescript single-page application (SPA) with a Flask API that connects to the Okta API.

You'll need an Okta API Token from an Okta user with the `Group Admin` and `Application Admin`
Okta administrator roles granted as well as all Group permissions (ie. `Manage groups` checkbox checked)
in a custom Admin role. If you want to manage Groups which grant Okta Admin permissions, then the Okta API
Token will need to be created from an Okta user with the `Super Admin` Okta administrator role.

### Flask

Create a `.env` file in the repo root with the following variables:

```
CURRENT_OKTA_USER_EMAIL=<YOUR_OKTA_USER_EMAIL>
OKTA_DOMAIN=<YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN> # For example, "mydomain.oktapreview.com"
OKTA_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_SANDBOX_API_TOKEN>
DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///access.db"
CLIENT_ORIGIN_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6060
```

Next, run the following commands to set up your python virtual environment. Access can be run with Python 3.11 and above:

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, seed the db:

```
flask db upgrade
flask init <YOUR_OKTA_USER_EMAIL>
```

Finally, you can run the server:

```
flask run
```

Go to [http://localhost:6060/api/users](http://localhost:6060/api/users) to view the API.

### Node

In a separate window, setup and run nodejs:

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the React SPA.

#### Generating Typescript React-Query API Client

We use [openapi-codegen](https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen) to generate a Typescript React-Query v4 API Fetch Client based on our Swagger API schema available at [http://localhost:6060/api/swagger.json](http://localhost:6060/api/swagger.json). We've modified that generated Swagger schema in [api/swagger.json](api/swagger.json), which is then used in [openapi-codegen.config.ts](openapi-codegen.config.ts) by the following commands:

```
npm install @openapi-codegen/cli
npm install @openapi-codegen/typescript
npm install --only=dev
npx openapi-codegen gen api
```

## Tests

We use tox to run our tests, which should be installed into the python venv from
our `requirements.txt`.

Invoke the tests using `tox -e test`.

## Linting

Run `tox -e ruff` and `tox -e mypy` to run the linters.

## Production Setup

Create a `.env.production` file in the repo root with the following variables. Access supports running against PostgreSQL 14 and above.

```
OKTA_DOMAIN=<YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN> # For example, "mydomain.okta.com"
OKTA_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_OKTA_API_TOKEN>
DATABASE_URI=<YOUR_DATABASE_URI> # For example, "postgresql+pg8000://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/access"
CLIENT_ORIGIN_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL=""
FLASK_SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@sentry.io/<project>
REACT_SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@sentry.io/<project>
```

### Google Cloud CloudSQL Configuration

If you want to use the CloudSQL Python Connector, set the following variables in your `.env.production` file:

```
CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME=<YOUR_CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME> # For example, "project:region:instance-name"
DATABASE_URI="postgresql+pg8000://"
DATABASE_USER=<YOUR_DATABASE_USER> # For a service account, this is the service account's email without the .gserviceaccount.com domain suffix.
DATABASE_NAME=<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>
DATABASE_USES_PUBLIC_IP=[True|False]
```

### Authentication

Authentication is required when running Access in production. Currently, we support
[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) (including Okta)
and [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) as methods to authenticate users to Access.

#### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

To use OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, such as with Okta:

Go to your Okta Admin dashboard -> Applications -> Create App Integration.

In the Create a new app integration, select:
- Sign-in method: `OIDC - OpenID Connect`
- Application type: `Web Application`

Then on the New Web App Integration page:
- App integration name: `Access`
- Logo: (optional)
- Grant type:
  - Client acting on behalf of user: `Authorization Code`
- Sign-in redirect URIs: `https://<YOUR_ACCESS_DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN_NAME>/oidc/authorize`
- Sign-out redirect URIs: `https://<YOUR_ACCESS_DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN_NAME>/oidc/logout`

Then click `Save` and go to the General tab of the new app integration to find
the `Client ID` and `Client secret`. You'll need these for the next step.

Create a `client_secrets.json` file containing your OIDC client secrets, that looks something like the following:
```
{
  "secrets": {
    "client_id":"<YOUR_OKTA_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret":"<YOUR_OKTA_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "issuer": "https://<YOUR_OKTA_INSTANCE>.okta.com/"
  }
}
```

Then set the following variables in your `.env.production` file:
```
# Generate a good secret key using `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'`
# this is used to encrypt Flask cookies
SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
# The path to your client_secrets.json file or if you prefer, inline the entire JSON string
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS=./client_secrets.json or '{"secrets":..'
```

#### Cloudflare Access

To use Cloudflare Access authentication, set up a
[Self-Hosted Cloudflare Access Application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/)
using a Cloudflare Tunnel. Next, set the following variables in your `.env.production` file:

```
# Your Cloudflare "Team domain" under Zero Trust -> Settings -> Custom Pages in the Cloudflare dashboard
# For example, "mydomain.cloudflareaccess.com"
CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN=<CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN>
# Your Cloudflare "Audience" tag under Zero Trust -> Access -> Applications -> <Your Application> -> Overview in the Cloudflare dashboard
# found under "Application Audience (AUD) Tag"
CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_AUDIENCE=<CLOUFLARE_ACCESS_AUDIENCE_TAG>
```

### Docker Build and Run

Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t access .
```

Or build and run it using Docker Compose:

```
docker compose up --build
```

The command above will build and run the container.

Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the application.

### Docker configuration

Before launching the container with Docker, make sure to configure `.env.psql` and `.env.production`:

#### Configuration for `.env.psql`

The `.env.psql` file is where you configure the PostgreSQL server credentials, which is also Dockerized.

- `POSTGRES_USER`: Specifies the username for the PostgreSQL server.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password for the PostgreSQL server.

#### Configuration for `.env.production`

The `.env.production` file is where you configure the application.

- `OKTA_DOMAIN`: Specifies the [Okta](https://okta.com) domain to use.
- `OKTA_API_TOKEN`: Specifies the [Okta](https://okta.com) [API Token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApiToken/) to use.
- `DATABASE_URI`: Specifies the Database connection URI. **Example:** `postgresql+pg8000://<POSTGRES_USER>:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@postgres:5432/<DB_NAME>`.
- `CLIENT_ORIGIN_URL`: Specifies the origin URL which is used by CORS.
- `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL`: Specifies the API base URL which is used by the frontend. Set to an empty string "" to use the same URL as the frontend.
- `FLASK_SENTRY_DSN`: See the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/). **[OPTIONAL] You can safely remove this from your env file**
- `REACT_SENTRY_DSN`: See the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/). **[OPTIONAL] You can safely remove this from your env file**
- `CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN`: Specifies the Team Domain used by [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/).
- `CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_AUDIENCE`: Specifies the Audience Tag used by [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/).
- `SECRET_KEY`: Specifies the secret key used to encrypt flask cookies. WARNING: Ensure this is something secure you can generate a good secret key using `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'`.
- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS`: Specifies the path to your client_secrets.json file or if you prefer, inline the entire JSON string.

**Check out `.env.psql.example` or `.env.production.example` for an example configuration file structure**.

**NOTE:**

If you are using Cloudflare Access, ensure that you configure `CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_AUDIENCE`. `SECRET_KEY` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS` do not need to be set and can be removed from your env file.

Else, if you are using a generic OIDC identity provider (such as Okta), then you should configure `SECRET_KEY` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS`. `CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_AUDIENCE` do not need to be set and can be removed from your env file. Make sure to also mount your `client-secrets.json` file to the container if you don't have it inline.

### Access application configuration

_All front-end and back-end configuration overrides are **optional**._

The default config for the application is at [`config/config.default.json`](config/config.default.json).

The file is structured with two keys, `FRONTEND` and `BACKEND`, which contain the configuration overrides for the
front-end and back-end respectively.

If you want to override either front-end or back-end values, create your own config file based on 
[`config/config.default.json`](config/config.default.json). Any values that you don't override will fall back to 
the values in the default config.

To use your custom config file, set the `ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the name of your config
override file in the project-level `config` directory.

### Sample Usage

To override environment variables, create an override config file in the `config` directory. (You can name
this file whatever you want because the name of the file is specified by your `ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable.)

For example, if you want to set the default access time to 5 days in production, you might create a file named
`config.production.json` in the `config` directory:

```json
{
  "FRONTEND": {
    "DEFAULT_ACCESS_TIME": "432000"
  }
}
```

Then, in your `.env.production` file, set the `ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the name of your
config file:

```
ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE=config.production.json
```

This tells the application to use `config.production.json` for configuration overrides.

#### Frontend Configuration

To override values on the front-end, modify these key-value pairs inside the `FRONTEND` key in your custom config file.

| Name                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example                                                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TIME_LABELS`      | Specifies the time access labels to use for dropdowns on the front end. Contains a JSON object of the format `{"NUM_SECONDS": "LABEL"}`.                                                                 | `{"86400": "1 day", "604800": "1 week", "2592000": "1 month"}` |
| `DEFAULT_ACCESS_TIME`     | Specifies the default time access label to use for dropdowns on the front end. Contains a string with a number of seconds corresponding to a key in the access time labels.                              | `"86400"`                                                      |
| `NAME_VALIDATION_PATTERN` | Specifies the regex pattern to use for validating role, group, and tag names.  Should include preceding `^` and trailing `$` but is not a regex literal so omit `/`  at beginning and end of the pattern | `"^[a-zA-Z0-9-]*$"`                                            |
| `NAME_VALIDATION_ERROR`   | Specifies the error message to display when a name does not match the validation pattern.                                                                                                                | `"Name must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores."`  |

The front-end config is loaded in [`craco.config.js`](craco.config.js). See
[`src/config/loadAccessConfig.js`](src/config/loadAccessConfig.js) for more details.

#### Backend Configuration

To override values on the back-end, modify these key-value pairs inside the `BACKEND` key in your custom config file.

| Name                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NAME_VALIDATION_PATTERN` | PCRE regex used for validating role, group, and tag names. Should not explicitly declare pattern boundaries: depending on context, may be used with or without a preceding `^` and a trailing `$`. | `[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9-]*`                                                                   |
| `NAME_VALIDATION_ERROR`   | Error message to display when a name does not match the validation pattern.                                                                                                                        | `Name must start with a capital letter and contain only letters, numbers, and hypens.` |

The back-end config is loaded in [`api/access_config.py`](api/access_config.py).

See [`api/views/schemas/core_schemas.py`](api/views/schemas/core_schemas.py) for details about how the pattern override
supplied here will be used.

#### Database Setup

After `docker compose up --build`, you can run the following commands to setup the database:

Create the database in the postgres container:
```
docker compose exec postgres createdb -U <POSTGRES_USER> <DB_NAME>
```

Run the initial migrations and seed the initial data from Okta:
```
docker compose exec discord-access /bin/bash
```

Then run the following commands inside the container:

```
flask db upgrade
flask init <YOUR_OKTA_USER_EMAIL>
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view your running version of Access!

### Kubernetes Deployment and CronJobs

As Access is a web application packaged with Docker, it can easily be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. We've included example Kubernetes yaml objects you can use to deploy Access in the [examples/kubernetes](https://github.com/discord/access/tree/main/examples/kubernetes) directory.

These examples include a Deployment, Service, Namespace, and Service Account object for serving the stateless web application. Additionally there are examples for deploying the `flask sync` and `flask notify` commands as cronjobs to periodically synchronize users, groups, and their memberships and send expiring access notifications respectively.

## Plugins

Access uses the [Python pluggy framework](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to allow for new functionality to be added to the system. Plugins are Python packages that are installed into the Access Docker container. For example, a notification plugin could add a new type of notification such as Email, SMS, or a Discord message for when new access requests are made and resolved.

### Creating a Plugin

Plugins in Access follow the conventions defined by the [Python pluggy framework](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

An example implementation of a notification plugin is included in [examples/plugins/notifications](https://github.com/discord/access/tree/main/examples/plugins/notifications), which can be extended to send messages using custom Python code. It implements the `NotificationPluginSpec` found in [notifications.py](https://github.com/discord/access/blob/main/api/plugins/notifications.py)

There's also an example implementation of a conditional access plugin in [examples/plugins/conditional_access](https://github.com/discord/access/tree/main/examples/plugins/conditional_access), which can be extended to conditionally approve or deny requests. It implements the `ConditionalAccessPluginSpec` found in [requests.py](https://github.com/discord/access/blob/main/api/plugins/conditional_access.py).

### Installing a Plugin in the Docker Container

Below is an example Dockerfile that would install the example notification plugin into the Access Docker container, which was built above using the top-level application [Dockerfile](https://github.com/discord/access/blob/main/Dockerfile). The plugin is installed into the `/app/plugins` directory and then installed using pip.

```Dockerfile
FROM access:latest

WORKDIR /app/plugins
ADD ./examples/plugins/ ./

RUN pip install ./notifications

WORKDIR /app
```

## TODO

Here are some of the features we're potentially planning to add to Access:

- A Group Lifecycle and User Lifecycle plugin framework
- Support for Google Groups and Github Teams via Group Lifecycle plugins
- Group (and Role) creation requests
- Role membership requests, so Role owners can request to add their Role to a Group
- OktaApp model with many-to-many relationship to App for automatically assigning AppGroups to Okta application tiles
- A webhook to synchronize group memberships and disabling users in real-time from Okta
