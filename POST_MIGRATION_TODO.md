# Post-Migration TODO

Follow-up work after the [Flask + Marshmallow → FastAPI + Pydantic v2 migration](https://github.com/discord/access/pull/425). Each item is intentionally **deferred** — the initial migration prioritized wire compatibility over idiomatic FastAPI, so several "make it nicer" changes were postponed to keep that diff focused and reviewable.

Items grouped roughly by surface area; ordering within each group is rough priority. Most items can be done independently of each other except where called out.

## Tooling

### 14. Strict type checking on routers + schemas

Tighten `ty` on `api/routers/`. It is currently listed in the relaxed
`[[tool.ty.overrides]]` block in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml); remove
it from the `include` list and resolve the resulting diagnostics.
(`api/schemas/` is already checked strictly — it's not in the override.)
Operations can stay loose initially since it's inherited from the Flask
era. Add a CI check that fails the build on new violations in those
directories.

## Test Ergonomics

### 16. Replace `factory_boy` with Pydantic-based builders

Either:
- Keep `factory_boy` but decouple it from the legacy SQLAlchemy session
  pattern, or
- Replace with [`polyfactory`](https://polyfactory.litestar.dev/) which
  generates fixtures from Pydantic models — keeps test data and request
  schemas in sync automatically.

## Security follow-ups (out of scope for the migration PR)

### 20. Nonce-based CSP

Drop `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` and `style-src` in
`api/middleware.py`. Generate a per-response nonce in
`SecurityHeadersMiddleware` and thread it through `build/index.html`
+ the React build pipeline so every inline `<script>` / `<style>`
carries the nonce. Touches the frontend; not a same-PR fix.
